## Vinted homework assignment

### How to run the project
From root (solution) folder, type ```cd vinted-hw-assignment```, then ```dotnet run input.txt```

### How to run tests
If current directory is the project directory, enter ```cd ..```, then ```cd Tests``` and finally ```dotnet test```

------------------------------------------------------------------

If ```System.TypeInitializationException``` or ```System.IO.FileNotFoundException``` exceptions are thrown when trying to run tests, make sure to copy ```shipping-info.json``` and ```input.txt``` files to ```bin/Debug/net8.0``` folder


If for some other reason the project or tests aren't able to be executed, pictures of the output can be found in root folder

------------------------------------------------------------------

P.S. Due to time constraints, I did not implement ```DiscountContext``` class tests; if I'll be invited to the technical interview, I could gladly show them.

P.P.S Task was done using MacOS and Jetbrains Rider
